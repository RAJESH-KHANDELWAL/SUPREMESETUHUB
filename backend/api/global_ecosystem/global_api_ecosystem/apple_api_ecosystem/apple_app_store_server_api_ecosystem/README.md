# Apple App Store Server API Ecosystem

App Store Server API and server notifications boundary for transaction history, subscription status, refunds and notification processing. Verify signed payloads and use idempotent event handling.

## Implementation status

Catalog and documentation scaffold only. No live API connector is claimed by this folder. Implement the provider-specific authentication, request signing, response validation, retries, rate limits, tenant authorization and deployment smoke tests before enabling operations.

## Security

Store credentials, signing keys and certificates only in server-side environment configuration or a managed secret store. Never commit secrets, expose them in browser code, or write them to logs. Apply least privilege and audit sensitive actions.

## Canonical provider

See the parent [Apple API Ecosystem](../README.md) and shared adapter `backend/integrations/providers/apple.py`.
