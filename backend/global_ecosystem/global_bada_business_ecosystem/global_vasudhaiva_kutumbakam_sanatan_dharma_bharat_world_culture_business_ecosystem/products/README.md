# Product Catalog

**Namespace:** `products/`

Product metadata, maker attribution, provenance, materials, pricing references, availability status, safety notes, shipping and return policy references.

## Required controls

- Source evidence, provenance and verification status where relevant.
- Created, updated and review timestamps with lifecycle status.
- Permission, license, consent and retention notes where relevant.
- Public/private field separation and access requirements.
